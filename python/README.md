JKSN Python reference implementation
====================================

This is the Python reference implementation of JKSN.

It is not the one which produces the smallest JKSN stream, neither the one which does the fastest processing.

Currently there may be some bugs. Feel free to report them.

### Usage

`jksn.py` can be invoked by command line. Use the option `--help` to see available arguments.

Or you can use `jksn.py` as a Python module. `dump`, `dumps`, `load`, `loads` are the most common methods.

You can read the source code to understand how it works.
