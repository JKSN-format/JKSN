JKSN JavaScript reference implementation
========================================

This is the JavaScript implementation of JKSN.

It is not the one which produces the smallest JKSN stream, neither the one which does the fastest processing.

It does not provide the full functionality of JKSN since JavaScript does not support them all. See the Python implementation for more functionality.

Currently there may be some bugs. Feel free to report them.
